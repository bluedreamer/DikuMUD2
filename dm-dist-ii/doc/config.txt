Configuration

By far this is the most complicated task of running a VME server.  This is
where you will have to decide what races, spells, skills, etc you want to
have.  This is where you will set up your login/logoff screens, etc.  

Directory Structure

We will start out our discussion on the directory structure that was created
when you untared this.  In our install directory (/home/mud/vme in our
case) you should have 5 other directories

/home/mud/vme
    bin
    etc
    lib
    log
    include

The bin directory contains all of VME's executable files ( the files that
actually run the mud ).  There is no configurable files located in this
directory.

The etc directory is where all of the configurable parameters of the mud
will be made, there are many files that will be edited using your faviorte
text editor in linux (ie emacs, vi, pico, jed, etc).  Each file will be
described below:

Server Configuration: server.cfg 

This file is line order sensitive. Do not move around the order of the
configuration lines. Comments and blank lines can be inserted and remove at
your leisure.  A comment is any line that begins with a # sign. 

The mudname that you want people to see in the main menu as they connect,
also used by the multiplexers while the vme server is being rebooted to
inform the players the mud is being rebooted, etc. NOTE:  The string must
begin and end with a ~.

mudname =~Valhalla Mud Server (VME) V1.0~

The list below is the directories and their locations, if you are having
trouble running VME you might try putting full pathnames instead of the
relative paths.

libdir = ~../lib/~
etcdir = ~../etc/~
logdir = ~../log/~
zondir = ~../zone/~
plydir = ~../ply/~

The mother port is used to communicate between the mplex and the vme server,
change this only if necessary, you must also then change the runmplex.sh
script to reflect the same.

motherport = 4999

The rent field determines how much rent is charged. 0 means disabeled, 100
means the same amount as specified in the zone files. Any number in between
is a percentage of the rent specified per object.

rent = 10

The Book of Blood.  The book of blood is used to implement player killing in
a controlled fashion.  Only players willing to sign the BOB will be allowed
to Player Kill or be Killed by a player.  This also stops looting of corpses
from a BOB to a non-BOB and vise versa.  Use "1" to let the server support
the Book of Blood, use 0 if not. If you choose not to use the Book of Blood
you must remember to remove the book from the zones as well as check that
there is no BOB DIL code hanging around in your zones to disturb you.  You
can search your zone files using grep. 
grep PC_PK_RELAXED *.zon 
grep "$BOB" *.zon 

It is recomended that you leave bob set to one unless you fully understand
what you will have to remove from the zone files and are comfortable doing
so.

bob = 1

When Alias Shout equals 0, then players are not allowed to make shout
statements in them VME alias dictionaries. When it equals 1 players can make
shouts in aliases.

Alias Shout = 0

Mainly for debugging.  If set to one, no special routines will be activated.
You should keep this at zero.

No Specials = 0

Don't set to anything but zero, unless directed to by technical support..
Used on obsure systems where you have to shutdown at high loads, etc. etc.

Lawful = 0

When BBS is set to TRUE to server will assume that the game is operating on
a BBS system.

BBS use assumes that all players connect via some terminal program instead
of telnet. This has to do with colour & hidden characters.

BBS = 0

Use 0 to disable accounting. All game play is free. Use 1 to enable
accounting.  Unless a business licence is purchased, this option is not
functional, all game play is free regardless.

accounting = 0

Here you can set at which level a newbie can shout...

shout = 3

The subnetmask and localhost ip numbers are used to specify which Internet
addresses are from the LAN. If you are not on the Internet, please omit
these or set them to "255.255.255.255" and "0.0.0.0" respectively.

If you are on the Internet, any connection which is from the LAN will bypass
the regular accounting system and have all such players play for free. If
you do not wish this to happen, set the addresses as shown above.

subnetmask = ~255.255.255.255~
localhost  = ~0.0.0.0~

The multiplexors can theoretically connect from any host (and that's
intentional). To avoid hacking attempts, here you specify a list of
different hosts that are trusted as "multiplexor" safe.

More are specified like usual namelists, e.g. ~127.0.0.1~ ~0.0.0.0~

mplex hosts = ~127.0.0.1~

Color specifications.

Some of these are interpreted as complete strings to be shown directly, and
some are merely "prefixes" like for example the color room title. The
control.txt (Color Codes) shows what each of the &c code are and their
respective colors.

Must have three numbers (%d), mana, enduance and hits

color prompt =~&c+c%dm/%de/%ldh&c+b>&cw&s~

color who  = ~&c+cPlayers&n&c+c-------&cw~

Must have six %s's following each other 1 = name, 2 = ~~ or ~ ~, 3 = title,
4 = ~~ or ~ (~, 5 = ~~ or guild 6 = ~~ or ~)~

color who elem  = ~&cc%s%s&cc%s&c+w%s%s%s&cw~

color room title  = ~&c+b~
color room text   = ~&cw~

color exits begin = ~&c+b[&c+cExits:&s&c+c~
color exits end   = ~&c+b]&cw~

When hitting someone in Melee, sent to attacker, defender, others.  Must
have three entries.

color melee hit    = ~&c+y~ ~&c+r~ ~&c+r~
color melee miss   = ~&c+b~ ~&c+b~  ~&c+b~
color melee nodam  = ~&c+g~ ~&cg~  ~&cg~
color melee shield = ~&c+w~ ~&c+w~  ~&c+w~
color melee death  = ~&cr~ ~&cb~  ~&cb~

The Zone List: zonelist

The zonelist file is used in order to tell VME which zones to boot up, and
what permissions and prescedance.  Each entry is a one line with six (6)
parameters as shown below.

	<zonename> <password> <compile> <priority> <loadlevel> <payplay>

Format is as follows:

1. Zonename 
  The on-disk filename of the zone.  This is the acutal file name of the zone
  minus the .zon extention.

2. Password
	Used solely for compiler scripts, at the time of this documentation no
	publicly available scripts are available, but there should be in the near
	future.

 3. Compile time errors
   Used solely for the (email/ftp) zone compiler. When set to 0 the zone is
	compiled with the vmecomp flag '-l' which causes all warnings to be
	treated as errors. Used for beginner / non-trusted builders.

4.   Reset priority and 'runtime priviliges'
   The primary purpose of this field, is to set in which order zones are
	reset at boot-time. It is important that "basic" zones are reset first,
	since there is a delay of 1 - 2 seconds between each zone reset. The
	second purpose is to set what access the zone is allowed via DIL.  When
	set to '0' it means the zone has 'root' privileges and is allowed to do
	stuff that can be ultimately destructive to the mud. This should only be
	set by the VME administrator and is only intended for the basis.zon and
	spells.zon to make spell implementation via DIL possible.

5. Load-level
	The load-level can be set individually for each zone. The load level is
	what level a wizard charecter must be in order to load an item from this
	zone.  The load level is overridden if the person attempting to load is
	the creator of the zone in question (i.e. in the %zone creators {...} ).

6. Pay only
	Set to 0 if anyone can play.  If set to "1" only players with a credit
	larger > 0 can play here.  If set to "2" only players with an active
	flatrate can play here.  If set to "3" players can play here with either
	of the above options.  This is only functional in the Business VME
	distribution.

<zonename> <password> <compile> <priority> <loadlevel> <payplay>

basis	trustme	1	0	250	0
skills	2skillme	1	0	250	0

Information Screens - logo, motd, welcome, newbie, wizlists, news, story, &
credits.

All of the above mentioned files are nothing but text files that will
display information to the user at different times of login/logoff, and on
certain commands.  All of these files may be contain color codes (refer to
Appendix A) and any other ascii standard charters.

logo - The logo file is what a user will see when he/she first connects to
VME.  This should probally be the name of your mud/server.

motd - This is the file that is displayed immediatly after the user has
successfully logged into VME.

welcome - The welcome screen will be displayed to the user after they choose
(1) on the login menu.

newbie - The newbie file will be displayed after a newuser has successfully
logged on to the system.

wizlist - The wizlist (Wizards List) is a file that show the current
wizards/builders on the mud when the wizlist command is issued by a player,
of course you can put any information you like as well.

news - The news file contains any current news, this will be displayed when
a user types news.

story - The story file is <????>

credits - The credits file is used to display credits when a player type
credits.

Help Files - help, help.wiz and help.local

The help files are files that are displayed to the users when they do a help
command.  The main help file help and the help.local files are available for
all users to see.  The help local file is a local help file for specific
topics relating to your own mud.  The help.wiz is a helpfile that only
Wizards will be able to see.  The general format of the help files is:

"topic" "more topic"
This is a help file on topic
#

"index" "help"
Check out the following topics:
 Topic
#


The first line is searched on when a user does help topic, when matched the
text below is displayed until the # sign.  Then another topic below that
ending with a # sign, and so on.

The file must end with a #~.

For more illisturation on the help files please examine help, help.local or
help.wiz.

Socials/Actions - actions

The actions file is a configuration file for socials.  This is where you can
define what a player sees when he types certain commands that are know as
socials, like scratch, kiss, dance, etc.  The file is a list of socials one
after the other in each having ten lines as described below.

<command-name> <act-flag> <min-pos user> <min-pos victim> <min-level>

<command-name>	The command that the person will type to activate this command.

<act-flag> Either someone or hideinv, refering to weather when the social
will display the persons name if they are invisible or wizinvs.  Someone
will display someone instead of the name for those that are invisible or
wizinvisible, hideinv does not.

<min-pos>	One of dead, sleep, rest, sit, fight, stand

<min-level>	The minimum level the person needs to be to use this command.

Then 3 or 8 more lines, like:

1.	Message to self, no victim.
2.	Message to others, no victim.
3.	A single #, meaning no more lines for this social command, OR       Message to self, when there's a victim.
4.	Message to others, with victim
5.	Message to victim.
6.	Message to self, victim not found.
7.	Message to self, victim is self.
8.	Message to others, victim is self.

The messages are built as documented for DIL's act(). 

Example:

	laugh someone rest dead 0
	You fall down laughing.
	$1n falls down laughing.
	You laugh wholeheartedly at $3n.
	$1n starts laughing at $3n.
	$1n laughs at your funny attitude.
	Not likely, as there is no-one her by that name.
	You laugh at yourself, aren't you just FUNNY?
	$1n laughs noisely for a time, seemingly amused by $1mself. 

If you have a single # at other lines than line 3, it means don't send any
text.  This can be used to have a private social, for example a telepathic
think command that only you and the victim is aware about.

It's also good for socials that demand a victim, for example: 
   squeeze someone rest dead 0
   Where, what, how, WHO ???
   #
   You squeeze $3n fondly.
   $1n squeezes $3n fondly.
   $1n squeezes you fondly.
   Where, what, how, WHO ???
   You squeeze yourself - try to relax a little !
   $1n squeezes $1mself.
