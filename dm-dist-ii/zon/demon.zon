teeth in his mouth, small horns on his head and scale like skin. This has to
be a demon fighter, it is said that they are ordinary fighters who have a
demon inside themselves instead of a soul. It is also said that they are
unbeatable in hand to hand combat. When you think back on your early days as
an adventurer you remember hearing about a warrior who stalks some strange
world in another dimension, he was supposed to have killed a demon prince
