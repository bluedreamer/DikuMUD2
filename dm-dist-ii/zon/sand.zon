/* Version Notes:

 5/17/96
  v15 - Eirinn changed crabs so that they don't continue to affect
	people after death.

 9/10/96
   v12 -- Changed my home, so that it has a less obnoxious name
          and loads a chat board.


 7/31/96
   v10 -- Fixed the immortal protection for crabs so that the dil
          destroys itself, also made the shrinking potion unquittable
          for both the courier and the shrunk person.

 7/25/96
   v9  -- Fixed the shrinking potion to use baseweight instead of 
          because people were getting really fat. :P
          Remove spl_open_gate() because it was put into basis.zon


 7/23/96
   v8  -- Changed the shrinking potion to set MANIPULATE_TAKE on the 
          character instead of blocking the get command and worrying 
          about all the linking problems, added the weight loss feature
          to make this more realistic and plausable.

 6/30/96
   v7  -- Changed SFUN_*'s to new restrict dils.

"This Zone is by, Philip Burch&n

&c+g javelin@nsccux.sccd.ctc.edu &cw &n
Feel free to mail me feedback this way as well as mudmail&n &n
The Beach area of this zone was created for level 20-40 characters.&n
The Cliff top area is the dwelling of Native American type peoples who are
traders of fur that they hunt. Under the cruel oppression of Baardekans,
who's superior advancement keeps them exploiting the Cheleho."

"&c+wThe beach zone is a long east west strip of beach, you can climb into
the cliffs and sail on the ocean, there are even a few quests here.
Remeber to consider mobs and you'll be fine.&n
&cwThis zone is for level 25 - 35's soloing. Look around for hidden stuff
there is some here, I haven't made it too tough as long as you read the
descriptions.. If you need help with something else, Yell for Sand or
Javelin, and I will help you as much as is allowed!&n"
