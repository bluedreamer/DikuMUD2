&c+g javelin@nsccux.sccd.ctc.edu &cw &n
Feel free to mail me feedback this way as well as mudmail&n &n

"&c+wThe keep is inhabited by spies who watch over Valhalla with a careful
eye, beware of mischievious mobiles and hidden surprises because they
may be watching you! The leader of the spies is Eros, but the master
overseer is Silk and she may be even more dangerous..&n
&cwThis zone is for 50 - 70's soloing or grouped. Look around for hidden
stuff there is some here, I haven't made it too tough as long as you
read the descriptions.. If you need help with something else, Yell for
Sand or Javelin, and I will help you as much as is allowed!&n"

disappear from the forest of Haon Dor and much concern spread through the
city. Rumours of Dragons hunting in the night brought fear into the hearts
of the udgaard people and doors were barred at night as they hadn't been in
generations.&n&s3Hondole came to the people of Udgaard and announced that he
too was afraid of the dragons, but he would not stand in fear any longer. Hondole
took a lance from his home and left for many months. When he returned, the large
head of a dragon accompanied him and there was much rejoicing in the city.
The slayings continued into the winter and the townspeople decided they should
reward Hondole for his bravery. The smithes of the city began to forge and
the priests began to pray, together they made three daggers; Body, Mind, and
Soul.&n&s3The essences of Dragons long dead were used along with the prayers of
the priests, to create ceremonial daggers for Hondole to carry and use to
carve the hearts out of slain beasts. Hondole's Triad they were called and
they are what I want. Since the death of Hondole, and the destruction of
all dragons near Udgaard the daggers have been spread throughout the land,
and they are:&n
